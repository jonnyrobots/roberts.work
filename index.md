<h1>Hi, I'm Jonathan</h1>
### Iâ€™m a designer & researcher who helps develop ideas into successful products, and products into successful businesses

#### Currently
Iâ€™m helping <a href="https://www.red-gate.com/" target="_blank">@redgate</a> evolve its product portfolio, working on new product development and its acquisition of [Flyway](https://flywaydb.org/). 

In my spare time I produce <a href="https://designance.substack.com">Designance</a>, a newsletter about the principles of design, finance and investing in software.  
                
#### Previously
I helped <a href="https://twitter.com/geomonitors" target="_blank">@geomonitors</a> move to a user-centered design process, enabling them to deliver<a href="https://twitter.com/@askcosy" target="_blank">@askcosy</a> for <a href="https://www.first-utility.com/cosy" target="_blank">first:utility</a>.
