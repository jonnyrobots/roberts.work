<h1>Hi, I'm Jonny. <span style="font-weight: 300">I help companies research their ideas, design great products, and create successful businesses.</span></h1>
<br/>
#### Currently

I work on product strategy and revenue growth for [flywaydb.org](https://flywaydb.org/), commercial Open Source software used by tens of thousands of development teams.

In my spare time I produce a <a href="https://designance.substack.com">newsletter</a> about the principles of design and finance, and work on bringing UX design to GUI-less software at <a href="https://designdev.tools">designdev.tools</a>.

#### Previously
I led the new product development team that created <a href="https://spawn.cc">spawn.cc</a>, and helped <a href="https://twitter.com/geomonitors" target="_blank">@geomonitors</a> move to a user-centered design process, enabling them to deliver <a href="https://twitter.com/@askcosy" target="_blank">@askcosy</a> for <a href="https://www.first-utility.com/cosy" target="_blank">first:utility</a>.
