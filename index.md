<br/>

I specialise in the research and development of commercial strategies that bring revenue growth through <a href="https://www.realwire.com/releases/Redgate-cements-position-as-leading-vendor-with-Flyway-acquisition">M&amp;A</a>, from <a href="https://spawn.cc">New Product Development</a>, and via improved <a href="https://www.red-gate.com/blog/database-devops/redgate-embraces-open-source-with-its-ongoing-development-of-flyway">Go-to-market</a>. 

#### Currently

I work at Redgate on building a product-led growth strategy for [Flywaydb](https://flywaydb.org/), commercial Open Source software used by 150,000 developers.

In my spare time I like to write; for independent software developers <a href="https://gitacquired.org">preparing for acquisition</a>, and about the principles of <a href="https://designance.substack.com">design and finance</a>.
