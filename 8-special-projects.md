# Special Projects

Special Projects provide data and insight for decision-making. They help early-stage projects, products and companies answer difficult, ambiguous questions. 

### How it works

A Special Project starts with a hypothesis that I publish, and that you can sponsor. I undertake the research when the sponsorship target is reached.

Special Projects are particularly valuable to early-stage projects, products and companies that don't have the time, skills or staff to focus on the problem full-time.

Projects have titles that reflect the ambiguous questions they set out to answer. For an early stage company, these may be questions like:

* Should we Open Source some aspect of our product?
* Is it worth building a user community?
* What will the AI market look like in 5 years? 

Sponsors get first access to the results of a research project, giving you actionable insight and alpha over your competitors. You also get the raw data should you wish to do your own analysis later.

Six months after the project is complete, I make the report generally available for anyone to purchase.

### FAQ
##### How did 'Special Projects' come about?
Talking to lots of early stage projects, products and companies, recognising a need for specialist research, and then recognising that I could provide that in a sustainable was (for me). The format (and name) is inspired by Craig Mod; the content is all me.
##### What if the project doesn't get fully funded? 
Projects go ahead regardless of funding level. If you sponsor a project, it will happen. The amount of sponsorship just determines the priority order that projects get completed in.
##### Who owns the data / report produced during the project?
I do. Sponsoring a project entitles you to obtain the report before the 6 month embargo expires and the report is made generally available. If you would like to own or restrict access to the data, please contact me. 
##### Can I suggest a research project
You can; I have a process for shaping Special Project hypotheses that I can work through with you, just send me an email, jonathan[@]roberts.work.
