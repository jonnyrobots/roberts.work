# Early-stage engineering

What attributes make for a high-performing engineering team working on early-stage challenges?

*Mastery of a programming language? Decades of experience? Air-tight specifications? Perfect application of Agile?*

**An early-stage, high-performing team simply understands the problem to be solved, and knows when it has solved it.**

They are a "one-pizza sized" team. They divide and conquer. They take 3 minutes to read the agile manifesto, and get on with it. They're relentless in building new skills. 

*Don't expect them to have, to follow or to craft the perfect process*

They break down work, assign it to one another and re-group after a few days. They are accountable to one another – and no one else – for their contribution. 

*Don't mistake meritocracy for exclusory behaviour*

They pair-up, but on problem-solving; not programming. They see "mob programming" as an anti-pattern in extremis; they know it's the software equivalent of 5 road workers watching 1 colleague dig a hole. 

*Don't measure output; programming is just the means to an end*

They are infuriating to work adjacent to. They are ruthless in their focus to the detriment of all else. 

*Don't expect great communication; this team is 99% walk, 1% talk.*

Except...

They will ask a lot of questions. If you're the person with the problem they're solving then you get all the questions, all the time. 

*Don't underestimate the depth of their understanding of a problem space*

They are truly autonomous. Not because they decide what to do, but because they know when they're working with imperfect information and seek to learn. 

*Don't expect them to only code the product; they code to understand a problem*

They experience problems – a lot – and fix them quickly. They learn from their mistakes by retrospecting, but not hours-long Retrospectives. They produce a concise write up, stash it in the repo and move on.

**Don't expect to need a team like this on every project, product or problem; just the ones with an abundance of ambiguity.**
