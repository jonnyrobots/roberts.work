# Mapping the AI space
### The 2020â€™s will be about AI

In the 2010's, automation delivered a step-change in productivity. Software that automated repetitive human tasks created enormous value.

In the 2020's, it'll be the turn of software that harnesses Machine Learning techniques â€“ automating vision- and language-based tasks â€“ to create the next step change. 

Once again, the challenge will be in packaging, distribution and capturing the value created by this technology.

AI list is an attempt to understand how the best companies in this space will do that.
