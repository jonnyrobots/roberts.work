# M&A for indie software devlopers
### A developer's guide to being acquired

Technology companies are cash rich and time poor. When they want to enter new markets, improve existing features or grow revenue it's often faster and more efficient to acquire.

I've spent over a decade researching, designing and developing new products. Sometimes it's much easier to acquire something someone else built.

I'm writing a guide based on my experience working on the project to acquire Flyway. It's designed to lift the lid on *what makes an acquisition target compelling* in the eyes of an acquirer, *what the M&A process entails* and how to come through it with the *best financial return* for the time you've invested.
