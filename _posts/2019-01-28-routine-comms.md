How communication is critical in product research and development.

## Routine comms
### The importance of stakeholder engagement

For people with a vested interest in our project, our ability to communicate with them is as important as the **research** and **development** itself.

Effective communication requires a time commitment. When you're a Lean team balancing research with development, it's easy to consider it an overhead.

Making more research calls, and writing more code is good for progress. These gains are easily mitigated when comms are lacking.

## Communication cohorts

There are three cohorts I like to think about when considering the cost we'll incur for failing to communicate routinely: 

Our **customers**, our **chiefs** and our **company** (_Alliteration?_ ✅. _Rule of three?_ ✅.). 

### Our customers

Releases are opportunities to (re)engage with our customer. 

Even the "new update available" message is a valuable micro communication (that the product is being worked on, for example).

Our research data provides confidence to invest in the next round of development. Short development cycles create frequent releases.  

Now imagine us completing research that's provided the confidence to embark on a bigger piece of development work over several sprints.

If our release cycle has been the sole communication method, then we're about to enter into a state of radio silence.

The next time we come to really engage with our customers, they're going to take longer to warm up to talking to us. 

### Our chiefs

The chiefs are the people who invest in the opportunities we uncover. 

As we carry out research, we immerse ourselves in learning more about the problem we've identified. We get excited about the opportunity. 

By their nature, ideas in their infancy aren't well-formed. They're difficult to describe. Innovation doesn't reflect the status quo.

The chiefs don't have the benefit of immersion. They still have to understand the opportunity/innovation in order to invest further.

Choosing to focus ours efforts on developing the solution and growing the user base, and less on comms, creates a vacuum for later.   

The next time we have to ask for more investment, it's going to take us longer to bring about the same level of enthusiasm in the chiefs.

### Our company

The company is a machine able to execute on proven opportunities. 

Having achieved product/market, we now have the benefit of dedicated engineering, sales and marketing functions. 

Sometimes, we see how a new technology can provide a novel and innovative solution to the customer problem we're working on. 

As we build out the prototype product, we learn how to harness that technology. Sure, we make mistakes, but our understanding grows. 

We can choose to favour technical progress over sharing technical knowledge. This creates a cost at execution time. 

In this example, it's the engineering function that's not ready to execute on developing the product further. 

In other examples, the new product may challenge the business model, or the marketing approach. Communicating these is our cost to carry.
