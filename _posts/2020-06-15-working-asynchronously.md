# Working asynchronously
### A template for reducing Zoom time

Sometimes I struggle to understand why I am in your meeting and often I suspect the feeling is mutual. 

Trying to figure out why we’re in yet another hour-long Zoom meeting is exhausting for everyone and over the past month I’ve been trying to do something about it.

I've been experiementing with moving to a more asynchronous way of working. Asynchronous is just a fancy word for two or more people <sup><a href="#footnotes">[1]</a></sup> working on the same thing, but at different times. 

Email is a simple example of asynchronous communication, as is collaborating on a shared document. It turns out that for distributed teams, working asynchronously on a shared document is extremely time-efficient and particularly pertinent <sup><a href="#footnotes">[2]</a></sup>.

My workflow now favours starting with a document over a meeting. Sometimes I struggle to understand why I am reading your document. Sometimes I suspect the feeling is often mutual. 

As a result, I’ve developed a process to help me approach writing a document that'll be used asynchronously. The general principle I follow when writing this document is that it should be able to stand up for itself and communicate for me in my absence. 

I begin with a summary in the form of answers to three basic questions (*What is this?*, *Why does it matter?* and *What is needed?*). Once I’ve set the scene, I move on to provide more *Background* information, describe the *Opportunity* and discuss the *Considerations*, enumerating the *pros* and *cons*. Finally, I wrap up with a blank section called *Actions*.

The simple act of writing this forces me to understand the problem better, and has the side effect of helping me communicate more succinctly. 

Beacuase I do this a lot, I've created a template which I've [shared here for you to use too](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WhuBFV0poU46l8FHoDXehrtyrbCiuqKfNcyGrAf66ls/edit?usp=sharing). It looks like this:

Once I've written this document, it's time to share it. Because the document is designed to be self explanatory,sharing it is as easy as writing a quick note to the people who need to read it - usually something as short as: 

> “I’ve been thinking about [challenge x], could you give this a read and let me know what you think, please?”

Once it’s in the hands of others, all that’s left to do is to agree on which *Actions* need to be taken, and who’s responsible for each. 

I think a Zoom call is the right tool at this point. There’s a certain social contract that’s formed when using synchronous communication to agree who’s responsible for each action, and being able to see and hear each other enforces that <sup><a href="#footnotes">[3]</a></sup>. 

When we get this right, the document means 75% of the work has been done asynchronously. When we get this really right, the efficiency we get from working around the document significantly reduces the amount of time needed for a Zoom call. I usually aim to keep these calls to 15 minutes.

If you’re still left wondering why this method is useful, then I’d recommend giving [Steve Glaveski’s article on remote work a read](https://medium.com/swlh/the-five-levels-of-remote-work-and-why-youre-probably-at-level-2-ccaf05a25b9c) - he gives a good overview of the five-levels of remote work developed by Matt Mullenwerg, founder of Automattic.

- [1] Or – since the word is most often used in computer programming – between two pieces of software in a system.
- [2] The meaning of pertinent should be implicit, but the reason perhaps less so. The short version is that a pandemic means the working day is no longer linear and in-sync. No longer having a physical office environment to synchronise our schedules for us means we're usually working on a different schedule to others.
- [3] An exception here is if the work item is code and the process involves Git, and specifically GitHub. Here it’s interesting to consider how explicit the contract is – through labels, or assignations, or Pull Requests – for a team working on a GitHub project.
