<h1>I'm Jonathan. <span style="font-weight: 300">I help companies research ideas, design great products, and create successful businesses.</span></h1>
<br/>

I specialise in delivering <a href="/special-projects">research data for commercial strategies</a> that go on to achieve revenue growth through <a href="https://www.realwire.com/releases/Redgate-cements-position-as-leading-vendor-with-Flyway-acquisition">M&amp;A</a>, via <a href="https://spawn.cc">New Product Development</a> and from an Open Source <a href="https://www.red-gate.com/blog/database-devops/redgate-embraces-open-source-with-its-ongoing-development-of-flyway">Go-to-market</a> approach. 

I work at Redgate where I'm responsible for building a product-led growth strategy for [Flywaydb](https://flywaydb.org/), commercial Open Source software used by 150,000 developers.

In my spare time I like to write; for independent software developers <a href="https://gitacquired.org">preparing for acquisition</a>, and about the principles of <a href="https://designance.substack.com">design and finance</a>.
