### A brief CV

I graduated from the University of Kent, Canterbury in 2006 with a BSc in [Multimedia Technology and Design](https://www.kent.ac.uk/courses/undergraduate/226/multimedia-technology-and-design) (First Class, Hons.). 

The course was part of the [School of Engineering](https://www.kent.ac.uk/engineering-digital-arts), but with modules co-taught by the [University for the Creative Arts](https://www.uca.ac.uk/) and [Kent Business School](https://www.kent.ac.uk/kbs/).

On paper the course looked like a clerical error. In reality it gave me an understanding of technology, design and business.

Fresh out of University, I found myself in my first role attempting digital transformation - long before I knew what that was - for a publishing company. We failed and I learned a lot.

I followed that with a role designing interfaces to spec for clients including IBM and JLT Group. Rigid specifications introduced me to the field of User Experience.

I moved on in 2012, and by 2014 I'd introduced [@geomonitors](https://twitter.com/geomonitors) to User Centered Design (UCD), designing energy systems for EDF at the London 2012 Olympics and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

UCD principles helped geo maintain their competitiveness when developing [Cosy](https://www.first-utility.com/cosy). Starting with 10 MVP users, Cosy grew to 10,000 customers within 12 months as First Utility's smart heating system. 

The MVP is forever immortalised as a [Kickstarter Project](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/greenenergyoptions/come-home-to-cosy-the-smart-heating-system-from-ge).

In 2014 I joined Redgate where I introduced [Lean UX](https://medium.com/@jonny_robots/moving-to-lean-ux-how-727361f8f7d2), taught other roles how to consider their users when developing applications and shared what I could with the UX community through talks and workshops.

Which brings me to today; leading [Redgate's](https://www.red-gate.com/) research, design and development team. It's a role that involves managing a team of software engineers, designers and researchers. 

Our mission is to help the executive team to make well informed decisions on what to invest in. We do that by **researching** trends, developing **new technology** and **bringing new products to market**.

If I'm not in the office, you'll find me at my desk writing [Designance](https:designance.substack.com) or out on my bike.
