## About Special projects
### Get decision-making insight

Special Projects have a theme, a proposal and a report:

- A Theme is usually a market or area that I am particularly interested in learning more about: *Artificial Intelligence*, or *Mergers and Acuqisitions*, for example   
- A Proposal is the outline of the question(s) I'm setting out to answer: "*What's the best go-to-market motion for NLP for developers?*", or "*What strategy provides the best return for bootstrapped founders getting acquired?*"
- A Report is the write up of the project, complete with data that provides decision-making guidance

### Insight for early-stage companies  

Special Projects are particularly valuable to early-stage projects, products and companies that don't have the time, skills or staff to focus on the problem full-time.

As a sponsor, you get first access to the results of the research project, giving you actionable insight and alpha over your competitors. You also get the raw data to run your own analysis later.

Six months after the project is complete, I make the report generally available for anyone to purchase.

### FAQ

##### What if the project doesn't get fully funded? 
They go ahead regardless. If you sponsor a project, it will happen. The amount of sponsorship simply determines the priority order that projects get completed in.
##### Who owns the data / report produced during the project?
I do. Sponsoring a project entitles you to obtain the report before the 6 month embargo expires and the report is made generally available. If you would like to own or restrict access to the data, please contact me.
##### If the report doesn't provide what I need, can I get my money back?
Yes. I want you to be able to use the report / data to make some business decision with confidence. I do my best to help you understand the project I'm about to embark on, and the kind of data I'm expecting to gather.
##### Can I suggest a research project?
You can; I have a process for shaping Special Project hypotheses that I can work through with you, just send me an email, jonathan[@]roberts.work.
##### How did 'Special Projects' come about?
I've been working on early-stage products and companies for the majority of my career and I wanted to start my own business. A lot of early-stage companies I've met need the sort of research I can undertake, but are unable to justify an full-time employee to do it. The commercial model (ie. sponsorship format) and name was inspired by Craig Mod.
