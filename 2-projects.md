### About Projects

In my spare time I work on projects that help people and companies with early-stage products. Creators of early-stage products are often faced with lots of good options and not enough data to decide to focus on one. The projects I work on are designed to provide data and insight to ease that decision-making. 

Projects are sponsored. Sponsors get first access to insight, as well as the raw data to run their own analysis from later. Six months after the project is complete, I make the report generally available for anyone to purchase.

### FAQ

##### What if projects don't get sponsored? 
They go ahead regardless. Sponsoring a project just speeds it along, and you'll get the data and insight at least 6 months before your competitor(s).
##### Who owns the data / report produced during the project?
I do. Sponsoring a project entitles you to the report before the 6 month embargo expires and the report is made generally available. If you would like to own or restrict access to the data, please contact me.
##### If the project doesn't provide what I need, can I get my money back?
Yes. I want you to be able to use the report / data to make some business decision with confidence. I do my best to help you understand the project I'm about to embark on, and the kind of data I'm expecting to gather.
##### Can I suggest a project?
Yes, you can; I have a process for shaping Project hypotheses that I can work through with you. Send me an email, jonathan[@]roberts.work.
##### How did 'Projects' come about?
I've been working on early-stage products and companies for the majority of my career and I wanted to start my own business. A lot of early-stage companies I've met need the sort of research I can undertake, but are unable to justify an full-time employee to do it. The commercial model (ie. sponsorship format) was inspired by Craig Mod.
